Instructions for building GJS on Visual Studio
==============================================
Building the GJS on Windows is now supported using Visual Studio
versions 2017 15.6.x or later in both 32-bit and 64-bit (x64) flavors,
via NMake Makefiles.  Due to C++-14 usage, Visual Studio 2015 or
earlier is not supported, nor is Visual Studio 2017 15.5.x or earlier,
as the compiler flag /Zc:externConstexpr is needed.

You will need the following items to build GJS using Visual Studio:
-SpiderMonkey 60 (mozjs-60).  Please see the below section carefully on this...
-GObject-Introspection (G-I) 1.41.4 or later
-GLib 2.54.x or later, (which includes GIO, GObject, and the associated tools)
-Cairo including Cairo-GObject support, unless NO_CAIRO=1 is specified.
-GTK+-3.20.x or later, unless NO_GTK=1 is specified.
-and anything that the above items depends on.

Note that SpiderMonkey must be built with Visual Studio, and the rest
should preferably be built with Visual Studio as well.  The Visual Studio
version used should preferably be the one that is used here to build GJS.

Be aware that it is often hard to find a suitable source release for
SpiderMonkey nowadays, so it may be helpful to look in

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/teams/releng/tarballs-needing-help/mozjs/

for the suitable release series of SpiderMonkey that corresponds to the GJS
version that is being built, as GJS depends on ESR (Extended Service Release,
a.k.a Long-term support) releases of SpiderMonkey.

Please do note that the build must be done carefully, in addition to the
official instructions that are posted on the Mozilla website:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation

For the configuration step, you will need to run the following:

(64-bit/x64 builds)
JS_STANDALONE=1 $(mozjs_srcroot)/js/src/configure --enable-nspr-build --host=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --target=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --prefix=--prefix=<some_prefix> --disable-jemalloc

(32-bit builds)
JS_STANDALONE=1 $(mozjs_srcroot)/js/src/configure --enable-nspr-build --prefix=<some_prefix> --disable-jemalloc

Notice that "JS_STANDALONE=1" and "--disable-jemalloc" are absolutely required,
otherwise GJS will not build/run correctly.  Please do not try to update the
NMake Makefiles to link to mozglue.lib!  Note in particular that a mozglue.dll
should *not* be in $(builddir)/dist/bin, although there will be a mozglue.lib
somewhere in the build tree (which, you can safely delete after building
SpiderMonkey).  The --host=... and --target=... are absolutely required for x64
builds, as per the Mozilla's SpiderMonkey build instructions.

You may want to pass in --disable-js-shell to not build the JS shell that comes
with SpiderMonkey to save time, and perhaps use --with-system-nspr (instead of
the --enable-nspr-build as above), --with-system-zlib and --with-system-icu if
you know what you are doing and that their pkg-config files (or headers/LIB's)
can be found directly or using configuration options, to further save time.

After the configuration finishes successfully, you may run 'mozmake' and
'mozmake install' as you would for a standard SpiderMonkey build.  If
'mozmake install' does not work for you for some reason, the DLLs you need
and js.exe (if you did not pass in --disable-js-shell) can be found in
$(buildroot)/dist/bin (you need *all* the DLLs, make sure that there is no
mozglue.dll, otherwise you will need to redo your build as noted above),
and the required headers are found in $(buildroot)/dist/include.  Note that
for PDB files and .lib files, you will need to search for them in $(buildroot),
where the PDB file names match the filenames for the DLLs/EXEs in
$(buildroot)/dist/bin, and you will need to look for the following .lib files:
-mozjs-60.lib
-js_static.lib (optional)
-nspr4.lib (optional, recommended for future use, if --enable-nspr-build is used)
-plc4.lib (optional, recommended for future use, if --enable-nspr-build is used)
-plds4.lib (optional, recommended for future use, if --enable-nspr-build is used)

You may want to put the .lib's and DLLs/EXEs into $(PREFIX)\lib and $(PREFIX)\bin
respectively, and put the headers into $(PREFIX)\include\mozjs-60 for convenience.

The following are instructions for performing such a build, as there is a
number of build configurations supported for the build.  Note that the default
build (where no options (see below) are specified, the GJS library is built with
Cairo and GTK+ support.  A 'clean' target is provided-it is recommended that
one cleans the build and redo the build if any configuration option changed.  An
'install' target is also provided to copy the built items in their appropriate
locations under $(PREFIX), which is described below.

Invoke the build by issuing the command:
nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[release|debug] [PREFIX=...] <option1=1 option2=1 ...>
where:

CFG: Required.  Choose from a release or debug build.  Note that
     all builds generate a .pdb file for each .dll and .exe built--this refers
     to the C/C++ runtime that the build uses.

PREFIX: Optional.  Base directory of where the third-party headers, libraries
        and needed tools can be found, i.e. headers in $(PREFIX)\include,
        libraries in $(PREFIX)\lib and tools in $(PREFIX)\bin.  If not
        specified, $(PREFIX) is set as $(srcroot)\..\vs$(X)\$(platform), where
        $(platform) is win32 for 32-bit builds or x64 for 64-bit builds, and
        $(X) is the short version of the Visual Studio used, as follows:
        2017: 15

Explanation of options, set by <option>=1:
------------------------------------------
NO_CAIRO: Disables Cairo support in the GJS DLL.

NO_GTK: Disables GTK+ support in the GJS DLL

INTROSPECTION: Enable build of introspection files, for making
               bindings for other programming languages available, such as
               Python.  This requires the GObject-Introspection
               libraries and tools, along with the Python interpreter that was
               used during the build of GObject-Introspection.  This will
               require the introspection files for GTK+, unless NO_GTK=1 is
               specified, where the introspection files for GIO will be
               required.

PYTHON: Full path to the Python interpreter to be used, if it is not in %PATH%.
        This is necessary for building the introspection files (INTROSPECTION=1).

LIBTOOL_DLL_NAME: Enable libtool-style DLL names.  Note this does not make this
                  GJS build usable by other compilers, due to C++ usage.
