The cairo bindings follows the C API pretty closely.

Naming
======

The module name is called 'cairo' and usually imported into
the namespace as 'Cairo'.

gjs> const Cairo = imports.cairo;

Methods are studlyCaps, similar to other JavaScript apis, eg

cairo_move_to is wrapped to Cairo.Context.moveTo()
cairo_surface_write_to_png to Cairo.Context.writeToPNG().

Abbrevations such as RGB, RGBA, PNG, PDF, SVG are always
upper-case.

Enums are set in the cairo namespace, the enum names are capitalized:

CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 is mapped to Cairo.Format.ARGB32 etc.

Surfaces (cairo_surface_t)
==========================

Prototype hierarchya

* Surface (abstract)
  * ImageSurface
  * PDFSurface
  * SVGSurface
  * PostScriptSurface

The native surfaces (win32, quartz, xlib) are not supported at this point.

Methods manipulating a surface are present in the surface class.
Creating an ImageSurface from a PNG is done by calling a static method:

gjs> let surface = Cairo.ImageSurface.createFromPNG("filename.png");


Context (cairo_t)
=================

cairo_t is mapped as Cairo.Context.

You will either get a context from a third-party library such
as Clutter/Gtk/Poppler or by calling the cairo.Context constructor.


gjs> let cr = new Cairo.Context(surface);

gjs> let cr = new Gdk.cairo_create(...);

All introspection methods taking or returning a cairo_t will automatically
create a Cairo.Context.

Patterns (cairo_pattern_t)
==========================

Prototype hierarchy

* Pattern
  * Gradient
    * LinearGradient
    * RadialGradient

You can create a linear gradient by calling the constructor:

Constructors:

gjs> let pattern = new Cairo.LinearGradient(0, 0, 100, 100);

gjs> let pattern = new Cairo.RadialGradient(0, 0, 10, 100, 100, 10);

gjs> let pattern = new Cairo.SurfacePattern(surface);

gjs> pattern.set_filter(Cairo.Filter.NEAREST);

TODO:
* context: wrap the remaning methods
* surface methods
* image surface methods
* solid pattern
* matrix
* version
* cairo_path_t and iteration

Fonts & Glyphs are not wrapped, use PangoCairo instead.
* glyphs
* text cluster
* font face
* scaled font
* font options
