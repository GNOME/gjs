# GJS: Javascript Bindings for GNOME

The current stable series is built on Mozilla's SpiderMonkey 91,
featuring **ECMAScript 2022** and GObject Introspection making most of
the **GNOME platform API** available.

To find out when a language feature was implemented in GJS, review [NEWS][gjs-news] in the GitLab repository. In many cases older versions of GJS can be supported using [polyfills][mdn-polyfills] and [legacy-style GJS classes](Modules.md#lang).

GJS includes some built-in modules like Cairo and Gettext, as well as helpers for some core APIs like DBus and GVariants. See the [Modules](Modules.md) page for an overview of the built-in modules and their usage.

## Documentation

There is official [GNOME API Documentation][gjs-docs] for GJS, including
everything from GLib and Gtk to Soup and WebKit2.

The [Mapping](Mapping.md) page has an overview of GNOME API usage in GJS such as subclassing, constants and flags, functions with multiple return values, and more.

Additional GJS documentation can be found under [doc](.).

[GJS Guide](gjs-guide) contains tutorials for begineers.

[GTK4 + GJS Book](https://rmnvgr.gitlab.io/gtk4-gjs-book/) is a start to finish walkthrough for the creation of GTK4 + GJS applications.

The main [GNOME developer portal][gnome-developer] contains numerous examples in JavaScript for GJS.

There are also a growing number of [examples][gjs-examples] and thorough tests of language features in the [test suite][gjs-tests].

## Applications

GJS is a great option to write applications for the GNOME Desktop.

The easiest way to get started is to use [GNOME Builder](gnome-builder), start a new project and select `JavaScript` language.

There is a also a [package specification] and [template repository] available.
