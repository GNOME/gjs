# GJS

GJS is JavaScript bindings for the GNOME platform APIs. Powered by
Mozilla's [SpiderMonkey][spidermonkey] JavaScript engine and
[GObject Introspection][gobject-introspection], it opens the entire GNOME
ecosystem to JavaScript developers.

The stable version of GJS is based on the latest Extended Support Release (ESR)
of SpiderMonkey. To find out when a language feature was added to GJS, review
[NEWS][gjs-news] in the GitLab repository.

## Documentation

If you are reading this file in the GJS repository, you may find it more
convenient to browse and search using the [API Documentation][gjs-docs] website
instead. There is documentation for GLib, GTK, Adwaita, WebKit, and many more
libraries. General documentation about built-in modules and APIs is under the
[GJS Topic](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/gjs).

[GJS Guide][gjs-guide] has many in-depth tutorials and examples for a number of
core GNOME APIs. The repository also has [code examples][gjs-examples] and
thorough coverage of language features in the [test suite][gjs-tests].

[GTK4 + GJS Book](https://rmnvgr.gitlab.io/gtk4-gjs-book/) is a start to finish
walkthrough for creating GTK4 applications with GJS.

The [GNOME developer portal][gnome-developer] contains examples of a variety of
GNOME technologies written GJS, alongside other languages you may know.

## Applications

GJS is a great option to write applications for the GNOME Desktop.

The easiest way to get started is to use [GNOME Builder][gnome-builder], start a
new project and select `JavaScript` language. There is a also a
[package specification] and [template repository][template] available.

### GNOME Shell Extensions

GJS is used to write [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org),
allowing anyone to make considerable modifications to the GNOME desktop. This
can also be a convenient way to prototype changes you may want to contribute to
the upstream GNOME Shell project.

There is documentation and tutorials specifically for extension authors at
[gjs.guide/extensions](https://gjs.guide/extensions).

### Embedding GJS

GJS can also be embedded in other applications, such as with GNOME Shell, to
provide a powerful scripting language with support for the full range of
libraries with GObject-Introspection.
