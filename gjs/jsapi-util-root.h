/* jsapi-util-root.h - Utilities for dealing with the lifetime and ownership of
 * JS Objects and other things that can be collected by the garbage collector
 * (collectively called "GC things.")
 *
 * GjsMaybeOwned<T> is a multi-purpose wrapper for a GC thing of type T. You can
 * wrap a thing in one of three ways:
 *
 * - trace the thing (tie it to the lifetime of another GC thing),
 * - root the thing (keep it alive as long as the wrapper is in existence),
 * - maintain a weak pointer to the thing (not keep it alive at all and have it
 *   possibly be finalized out from under you).
 *
 * To trace or maintain a weak pointer, simply assign a thing of type T to the
 * GjsMaybeOwned wrapper. For tracing, you must call the trace() method when
 * your other GC thing is traced.
 *
 * Rooting requires a JSContext so can't just assign a thing of type T. Instead
 * you need to call the root() method to set up rooting.
 *
 * If the thing is rooted, it will be unrooted either when the GjsMaybeOwned is
 * destroyed, or when the JSContext is destroyed. In the latter case, you can
 * get an optional notification by passing a callback to root().
 *
 * To switch between one of the three modes, you must first call reset(). This
 * drops all references to any GC thing and leaves the GjsMaybeOwned in the
 * same state as if it had just been constructed.
 */

/* This struct contains operations that must be implemented differently
 * depending on the type of the GC thing. Add more types as necessary. If an
 * implementation is never used, it's OK to leave it out. The compiler will
 * complain if it's used somewhere but not instantiated here.
