I made this contribution at GitHub.  I was encouraged by the maintainer to move the contribution here since they supposedly don't have merge permissions on their own repo.  This is obviously a play to get GitHub community members contributing to GNOME, by pretending to join GitHub.

GitLab has been set up with eslint for this project.  That's great, I applaud them for using it to enforce a coding style.  However if they're going to make a coding style mandatory, then they need to make the project editor compatible with their coding style.  Otherwise they are pissing away contributor man-hours, which is a slap in the face to all of us.

I will merge this when they get around to adding a pretty-print button to the project editor which fixes the coding style.  Everyone else should do the same.  One person at GitLab investing the effort to add that button in order to get community contributions is not a lot to ask.  Asking every contributor to manually fix their edits, wait on failed pull requests etc, is a cancer on the contributors precious time, and bluntly I am not prepared to contribute to something that pisses away community man hours.
