Version 1.47.90
---------------

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 38, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 31.
  Our plans are to continue upgrading to subsequent ESRs as maintainer
  availability allows. Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New syntax
    + Shorthand syntax for method definitions: { foo() { return 5; } }
    + Shorthand syntax for object literals: let b = 42; let o = {b}; o.b === 42
    + Computed property names for the above, as well as in getter and setter
      expressions and destructuring assignment: { ['b' + 'ar']() { return 6; } }
    + Spread operator in destructuring assignment: let [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3];
    + Template literals: `Hello, ${name}` with optional tags: tag`string`

  * New APIs
    + Symbol, a new fundamental type
    + WeakSet, a Set which does not prevent its members from being
      garbage-collected
    + [Symbol.iterator] properties for Array, Map, Set, String, TypedArray, and
      the arguments object
    + New Array and TypedArray functionality: Array.copyWithin(), Array.from()
    + New return() method for generators
    + New Number.isSafeInteger() method
    + New Object.assign() method which can replace Lang.copyProperties() in many
      cases
    + New Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() method
    + New RegExp flags, global, ignoreCase, multiline, sticky properties that
      give access to the flags that the regular expression was created with
    + String.raw, a tag for template strings similar to Python's r""
    + New TypedArray methods for correspondence with Array: entries(), every(),
      fill(), filter(), find(), findIndex(), forEach(), indexOf(), join(),
      keys(), lastIndexOf(), map(), of(), reduce(), reduceRight(), reverse(),
      slice(), some(), values()

  * New behaviour
    + Temporal dead zone: print(x); let x = 5; no longer allowed
    + Full ES6-compliant implementation of const keyword
    + The Set, Map, and WeakMap constructors can now take null as their argument
    + The WeakMap constructor can now take an iterable as its argument
    + The Function.name and Function.length properties are configurable
    + When subclassing Map, WeakMap, and Set or using the constructors on
      generic objects, they will look for custom set() and add() methods.
    + RegExp.source and RegExp.toString() now deal with empty regexes, and
      escape their output.
    + Non-object arguments to Object.preventExtensions() now do not throw an
      exception, simply return the original object

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + It is now a syntax error to declare the same variable twice with "let" or
      "const" in the same scope. Existing code may need to be fixed, but the
      fix is trivial.
    + SpiderMonkey is now extra vocal about warning when you access an
      undefined property, and this causes some false positives. You can turn
      this warning off by setting GJS_DISABLE_EXTRA_WARNINGS=1. If it is overly
      annoying, let me know and I will consider making it disabled by default
      in a future release.
    + When enumerating the importer object (i.e.,
      "for (let i in imports) {...}") you will now get the names of any built-in
      modules that have previously been imported. (But don't do this, anyway.)

- Closed bugs:

  * SpiderMonkey 38 prep [#776966, Philip Chimento]
  * Misc fixes [#777205, Philip Chimento]
  * missing class name in error message [#642506, Philip Chimento]
  * Add continuous integration to GJS [#776549, Claudio André]
  * Switch to SpiderMonkey 38 [#777962, Philip Chimento]

- Progress towards a build of GJS on Windows [Chun-wei Fan]
- Progress towards increasing test coverage [Claudio André]
- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.47.4
--------------

- New JavaScript feature: ES6 Promises. This release includes Lie [1], a small,
  self-contained Promise implementation, which is imported automatically to
  form the Promise global object [2]. In the future, Promises will be built into
  the SpiderMonkey engine and Lie will be removed, but any code using Promises
  will continue to work as before.

  [2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * New API: The GjsCoverage type and its methods are now exposed. Use this if
    you are embedding GJS and need to output code coverage statistics.

- Closed bugs:

  * Add GjsCoverage to gjs-1.0 public API [#775776, Philip Chimento]
  * Should use uint32_t instead of u_int32_t in coverage.cpp [#776193, Shawn
    Walker, Alan Coopersmith]
  * Port tests to use an embedded copy of Jasmine [#775444, Philip Chimento]
  * support fields in GObject [#563391, Havoc Pennington, Philip Chimento]
  * Javascript errors in property getters and setter not always reported
    [#730101, Matt Watson, Philip Chimento]
  * Exception swallowed while importing Gom [#737607, Philip Chimento]
  * log a warning if addSignalMethods() replaces existing methods [#619710, Joe
    Shaw, Philip Chimento]
  * Provide a useful toString for importer and module objects [#636283, Jasper
    St. Pierre, Philip Chimento]
  * Fails to marshal out arrays [#697020, Paolo Borelli]
  * coverage: Don't warn about executing odd lines by default anymore [#751146,
    Sam Spilsbury, Philip Chimento]
  * coverage: Crash in EnterBaseline on SpiderMonkey when Ion is enabled during
    coverage mode. [#742852, Sam Spilsbury, Philip Chimento]
  * installed tests cannot load libregress.so [#776938, Philip Chimento]
  * Crash with subclassed fundamental with no introspection [#760057, Lionel
    Landwerlin]

- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento, Claudio André]

Version 1.47.3
--------------

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 31, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 24.
  Our plans are to continue upgrading to subsequent ESRs as maintainer
  availability allows. Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New syntax
    + Spread operator in function calls: someFunction(arg1, arg2, ...iterableObj)
    + Generator functions: yield, function*, yield*
    + Binary and octal numeric literals: 0b10011100, 0o377
    + Function arguments without defaults can now come after those with
      defaults: function f(x=1, y) {}

  * New standard library module
    + Intl - Locale-sensitive formatting and string comparison

  * New APIs
    + Iterator protocol - any object implementing certain methods is an
      "iterator"
    + New Array functionality: fill(), find(), findIndex(), of()
    + New String functionality for working with Unicode: codePointAt(),
      fromCodePoint(), normalize()
    + New Array methods for correspondence with Object: entries(), keys()
    + ES6 Generator methods to replace the old Firefox-specific generator API:
      next(), throw()
    + forEach() methods for Map and Set, for correspondence with Array
    + A bunch of new Math functions: acosh(), asinh(), atanh(), cbrt(), clz32(),
      cosh(), expm1(), fround(), hypot(), log10(), log1p(), log2(), sign(),
      sinh(), tanh(), trunc()
    + Some constants to tell information about float support on the platform:
      Number.EPSILON, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
    + New Number.parseInt() and Number.parseFloat() which are now preferred over
      those in the global namespace
    + New Object.setPrototypeOf() which now is preferred over setting
      obj.prototype.__proto__
    + New locales and options extra arguments to all toLocaleString() and
      related methods
    + Misc new functionality: ArrayBuffer.isView(), Proxy.handler.isExtensible,
      Proxy.revocable()

  * New behaviour
    + -0 and +0 are now considered equal as Map keys and Set values
    + On typed arrays, numerical indexed properties ignore the prototype object:
      Int8Array.prototype[20] = 'foo'; (new Int8Array(32))[20] == 0

  * New non-standard Mozilla extensions
    + Array comprehensions
    + Generator comprehensions; both were originally proposed for ES6 but removed

- Backwards-incompatible change: we have changed the way certain JavaScript
  values are marshalled into GObject introspection 32 or 64-bit signed integer
  values, to match the ECMA standard. Here is the relevant section of the
  standard:
  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-toint32
  Notable differences between the old and new behaviour are:

  * Floating-point numbers ending in 0.5 are rounded differently when
    marshalled into 32 or 64-bit signed integers. Previously they were
    rounded to floor(x + 0.5), now they are rounded to
    signum(x) * floor(abs(x)) as per the ECMA standard:
    http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-toint32
    Note that previously, GJS rounded according to the standard when
    converting to *unsigned* integers!

  * Objects whose number value is NaN (e.g, arrays of strings), would
    previously fail to convert, throwing a TypeError. Now they convert to
    0 when marshalled into 32 or 64-bit signed integers.

  Note that the new behaviour is the behaviour you got all along when using
  pure JavaScript, without any GObject introspection:

  gjs> let a = new Int32Array(2);
  gjs> a[0] = 10.5;
  10.5
  gjs> a[1] = ['this', 'is', 'fine'];
  this,is,fine
  gjs> a[0]
  10
  gjs> a[1]
  0

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * New API: gjs_error_quark() is now exposed, and the error domain GJS_ERROR
    and codes GJS_ERROR_FAILED and GJS_ERROR_SYSTEM_EXIT.

  * Backwards-incompatible change: Calling System.exit() from JS code will now
    not abort the program immediately, but instead will return immediately from
    gjs_context_eval() so that you can unref your GjsContext before internal
    resources are released on exit.

    If gjs_context_eval() or gjs_context_eval_file() returns an error with code
    GJS_ERROR_SYSTEM_EXIT, it means that the JS code called System.exit(). The
    exit code will be found in the 'exit_status_p' out parameter to
    gjs_context_eval() or gjs_context_eval_file(). If you receive this error,
    you should do any cleanup needed and exit your program with the given exit
    code.

- Closed bugs:

  * spidermonkey 31 prep [Philip Chimento, Tim Lunn, #742249]
  * Please use dbus-run-session to run dbus related tests [Philip Chimento,
    #771745]
  * don't abort gdb'd tests [Philip Chimento, Havoc Pennington, #605972]

  * please add doc/ directory to make dist tar file [Philip Chimento, #595439]
  * support new mozjs 31.5 [Philip Chimento, #751252]
  * SEGFAULT in js::NewObjectWithClassProtoCommon when instantiating a dynamic
    type defined in JS [Philip Chimento, Juan Pablo Ugarte, #770244]

- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento, Alexander Larsson]

Version 1.47.0
--------------

- New API: GLib.log_structured() is a convenience wrapper for the C function
  g_log_variant(), allowing you to do structured logging without creating
  GVariants by hand. For example:

  GLib.log_structured('test', GLib.LogLevelFlags.LEVEL_WARNING, {
      'MESSAGE': 'Just a test',
      'A_FIELD': 'A value',
  });

- Backwards-incompatible change: we have changed the way gjs-console interprets
  command-line arguments. Previously there was a heuristic to try to decide
  whether "--help" given on the command line was meant for GJS itself or for a
  script being launched. This did not work in some cases, for example:

  $ gjs -c 'if (ARGV.indexOf("--help") == -1) throw "ugh"' --help

  would print the GJS help.

  Now, all arguments meant for GJS itself must come _before_ the name of the
  script to execute or any script given with a "-c" argument. Any arguments
  _after_ the filename or script are passed on to the script. This is the way
  that Python handles its command line arguments as well.

  If you previously relied on any -I arguments after your script being added to
  the search path, then you should either reorder those arguments, use GJS_PATH,
  or handle -I inside your script, adding paths to imports.searchPath manually.

  In order to ease the pain of migration, GJS will continue to take those
  arguments into account for the time being, while still passing them on to the
  script. A warning will be logged if you are using the deprecated behaviour.

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * Removed API: The gjs-internals-1.0 API is now discontinued. Since
    gnome-shell was the only known user of this API, its pkg-config file has
    been removed completely and gnome-shell has been patched not to use it.

- Closed bugs:

  * make check fails with --enable-debug / -DDEBUG spidermonkey [Philip
    Chimento, #573335]
  * Modernize autotools configuration [Philip Chimento, #772027]
  * overrides/GLib: Add log_structured() - wrapper for g_log_variant() [Jonh
    Wendell, #771598]
  * Remove gjs-internals-1.0 API [Philip Chimento, #772386]
  * Add support for boolean, gunichar, and 64-bit int arrays [Philip Chimento,
    #772790]
  * add a --version flag [Philip Chimento, #772033]
  * Switch to AX_COMPILER_FLAGS and compile warning-free [Philip Chimento,
    #773297]
  * Reinstate importer test [Philip Chimento, #773335]
