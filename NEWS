Version 1.65.90
---------------

- GJS now has an optional, Linux-only, dependency on libsysprof-capture-4
  instead of libsysprof-capture-3 for the profiler functionality.

- New API: gjs_coverage_enable() allows the collection of code coverage metrics.
  If you are using GjsCoverage, it is now required to call gjs_coverage_enable()
  before you create the first GjsContext. Previously this was not necessary, but
  due to changes in SpiderMonkey 78 you must now indicate in advance if you want
  to collect code coverage metrics.

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 78, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 68.
  Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New language features
    + A new regular expression engine, supporting lookbehind and named capture
      groups, among other things

  * New syntax
    + The ?? operator ("nullish coalescing operator") is now supported
    + The ?. operator ("optional chaining operator") is now supported
    + Public static class fields are now supported
    + Separators in numeric literals are now supported: for example, 1_000_000

  * New APIs
    + String.replaceAll() for replacing all instances of a string inside another
      string
    + Promise.allSettled() for awaiting until all Promises in an array have
      either fulfilled or rejected
    + Intl.Locale
    + Intl.ListFormat
    + Intl.RelativeTimeFormat.formatToParts()

  * New behaviour
    + There are a lot of minor behaviour changes as SpiderMonkey's JS
      implementation conforms ever closer to existing ECMAScript standards and
      adopts new ones. For complete information, read the Firefox developer
      release notes:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/69#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/70#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/71#JavaScript

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/77#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/78#JavaScript

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + The Object.toSource() method has been removed
    + The uneval() global function has been removed
    + A leading zero is now never allowed for BigInt literals, making 08n and
      09n invalid similar to the existing error when legacy octal numbers like
      07n are used
    + The Function.caller property now has the value of null if the caller is a
      strict, async, or generator function, instead of throwing a TypeError

- Backwards-incompatible change: Paths specified on the command line with
  the --coverage-prefix argument, are now always interpreted as paths. If they
  are relative paths, they will be resolved relative to the current working
  directory. In previous versions, they would be treated as string prefixes,
  which led to unexpected behaviour when the path of the script was absolute
  and the coverage prefix relative, or vice versa.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Port to libsysprof-capture-4.a [!457, Philip Withnall, Philip Chimento]
  * CI: Switch ASAN jobs to runners tagged so [!461, Bartłomiej Piotrowski]

  child widgets. (`for (let child of widget) { ... }`)

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Installed tests are not in preferred directories [#318, !427, Ross Burton]

--------------

- Various backports
  * 1.63.3: test suite is failing [Philip Chimento]
  * Various fixes for potential crash and memory issues [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.65.2
--------------

- It's now possible to omit the getter and setter for a GObject property on your
  class, if you only need the default behaviour (reading and writing the
  property, respecting the default value if not set, and implementing property
  notifications if the setter changes the value.) This should cut down on
  boilerplate code and any mistakes made in it.

- The log level of exception messages has changed. Previously, some exceptions
  would be logged as critical-level messages even when they were logged
  intentionally with logError(). Now, critical-level messages are only logged
  when an exception goes uncaught (programmer error) and in all other cases a
  warning-level message is logged.

--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Fix Visual Studio builds of gnome-3-34 (1.58.x) branch [Chun-wei Fan, !392]
  * Can not access GObject properties of classes without GI information [Juan
    Pablo Ugarte, !385, #299]

Version 1.63.90
---------------

- New JS API: The GObject module has gained new overrides:
  GObject.signal_handler_find(), GObject.signal_handlers_block_matched(),
  GObject.signal_handlers_unblock_matched(), and
  GObject.signal_handlers_disconnect_matched(). These overrides replace the
  corresponding C API, which was not idiomatic for JavaScript and was not fully
  functional because it used bare C pointers for some of its functionality.
  See modules/overrides/GObject.js for API documentation.

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 68, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 60.
  Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New language features
    + The BigInt type, currently a stage 3 proposal in the ES standard, is now
      available.

  * New syntax
    + `globalThis` is now the ES-standard supported way to get the global
      object, no matter what kind of JS environment. The old way, `window`, will
      still work, but is no longer preferred.
    + BigInt literals are expressed by a number with "n" appended to it: for
      example, `1n`, `9007199254740992n`.

  * New APIs
    + String.prototype.trimStart() and String.prototype.trimEnd() now exist and
      are preferred instead of trimLeft() and trimRight() which are nonstandard.
    + String.prototype.matchAll() allows easier access to regex capture groups.
    + Array.prototype.flat() flattens nested arrays, well-known from lodash and
      similar libraries.
    + Array.prototype.flatMap() acts like a reverse filter(), allowing adding
      elements to an array while iterating functional-style.
    + Object.fromEntries() creates an object from iterable key-value pairs.
    + Intl.RelativeTimeFormat is useful for formatting time differences into
      human-readable strings such as "1 day ago".
    + BigInt64Array and BigUint64Array are two new typed array types.

  * New behaviour
    + There are a lot of minor behaviour changes as SpiderMonkey's JS
      implementation conforms ever closer to existing ECMAScript standards and
      adopts new ones. For complete information, read the Firefox developer
      release notes:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/61#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/62#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/63#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/64#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/65#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/66#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/67#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/68#JavaScript

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + The nonstandard String generics were removed. These had only ever been
      implemented by Mozilla and never made it into a standard. (An example of a
      String generic is calling a string method on something that might not be a
      string like this: `String.endsWith(foo, 5)`. The proper way is
      `String.prototype.endsWith.call(foo, 5)` or converting `foo` to a string.)
      This should not pose much of a problem for existing code, since in the
      previous version these would already print a deprecation warning whenever
      they were used.
      You can use `moz68tool` from mozjs-deprecation-tools
      (https://gitlab.gnome.org/ptomato/moz60tool) to scan your code for this
      nonstandard usage.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * invalid import on signal.h [#295, !382, Philip Chimento]
  * SpiderMonkey 68 [#270, !386, Philip Chimento]
  * GObject: Add override for GObject.handler_block_by_func [#290, !371, Philip
    Chimento]

Version 1.63.3
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * JS ERROR: TypeError: this._rooms.get(...) is undefined [Philip Chimento,
    #289, !367]
  * Run CI build with --werror [Philip Chimento, #286, !365]
  * build: Remove Autotools build system [Philip Chimento, !364]
  * gjs-symlink script is incompatible with distro builds [Michael Catanzaro,
    Bastien Nocera, #291, !369, !370]
  * installed-tests: Don't hardcode the path of bash [Ting-Wei Lan, !372]
  * Update Visual Studio build instructions (after migrating to full Meson-based
    builds) [Chun-wei Fan, !375]
  * object: Warn when setting a deprecated property [Florian Müllner, !378]
  * CI: Create mozjs68 CI images [Philip Chimento, !379]
  * Various maintenance [Philip Chimento, !374, !380, !381]

Version 1.58.4
--------------

- Now prints a warning when constructing an unregistered object inheriting from
  GObject (i.e. if you forgot to use GObject.registerClass.) In 1.58.2 this
  would throw an exception, which broke some existing code, so that change was
  reverted in 1.58.3. In this version the check is reinstated, but we log a
  warning instead of throwing an exception, so that people know to fix their
  code, but without breaking things.
  NOTE: In 1.64 (the next stable release) the warning will be changed back into
  an exception, because code with this problem can be subtly broken and cause
  unexpected errors elsewhere. So make sure to fix your code if you get this
  warning.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * GSettings crash fixes [Andy Holmes, !373]

- Memory savings for Cairo objects [Philip Chimento, !374]

- Fix for crash in debug functions [Philip Chimento, !374]

Version 1.63.2
--------------

- There is an option for changing the generated GType name for GObject classes
  created in GJS to a new scheme that is less likely to have collisions. This
  scheme is not yet the default, but you can opt into it by setting
  `GObject.gtypeNameBasedOnJSPath = true;` as early as possible in your
  prograṁ. Doing this may require some changes in Glade files if you use
  composite widget templates.

  We recommend you make this change in your codebase as soon as possible, to
  avoid any surprises in the future.

- New JS API: GObject.Object has gained a stop_emission_by_name() method which
  is a bit more idiomatic than calling GObject.signal_stop_emission_by_name().

- It's now supported to use the "object" attribute in a signal connection in a
  composite widget template in a Glade file.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * CI: Tweak eslint rule for unneeded parentheses [Florian Müllner, !353]
  * Smarter GType name computation [Marco Trevisan, !337]
  * Meson CI [Philip Chimento, !354]
  * Visual Studio builds using Meson [Chun-wei Fan, !355]

  * Allow creating custom tree models [Giovanni Campagna, #71]
  * build: Fix dist files [Florian Müllner, !357]
  * GObject: Add convenience wrapper for signal_stop_emission_by_name() [Florian
    Müllner, !358]
  * Various maintenance [Philip Chimento, !356]
  * object_instance_props_to_g_parameters should do more check on argv [Philip
    Chimento, #63, !359]
  * Support flat C arrays of structures [Philip Chimento, !361]
  * Gtk Templates: support connectObj argument [Andy Holmes, !363]

- Various build fixes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.58.2
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * GObject based class initialization checks [Marco Trevisan, Philip Chimento,
    !336]
  * Silently leaked return value of callbacks [Xavier Claessens, Philip
    Chimento, #86, !44]
  * Crash when calling Gio.Initable.async_init with not vfunc_async_init
    implementation [Philip Chimento, #287, !362]
  * [cairo] insufficient checking [Philip Chimento, #49, !360]

- Various crash fixes backported from the development branch that didn't close
  a bug or merge request.

Version 1.63.1
--------------

- Note that the 1.59, 1.60, 1.61, and 1.62 releases are hereby skipped, because
  we are calling the next stable series 1.64 to match gobject-introspection and
  GLib.

- GJS now includes a Meson build system. This is now the preferred way to build
  it; however, the old Autotools build system is still available for a
  transitional period.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * GObject: Add convenience wrapper for signal_handler_(un)block() [Florian
    Müllner, !326]
  * GObject based class initialization checks [Marco Trevisan, Philip Chimento,
    !336]
  * Meson port [Philip Chimento, !338]
  * add http client example [Sonny Piers, !342]
  * Smaller CI, phase 2 [Philip Chimento, !343]
  * add websocket client example [Sonny Piers, !344]
  * Fix Docker images build [Philip Chimento, !345]
  * CI: Use new Docker images [Philip Chimento, !346]
  * docs: Update internal links [Andy Holmes, !348]
  * Don't pass generic marshaller to g_signal_newv() [Niels De Graef, !349]
  * tests: Fail debugger tests if command failed [Philip Chimento, !350]
  * Minor CI image fixes [Philip Chimento, !351]
  * Various fixes [Marco Trevisan, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.58.1
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Import wiki documentation [Sonny Piers, !341]
  * Smaller CI, phase 1 [Philip Chimento, !339]
  * Crashes after setting child property 'icon-name' on GtkStack then displaying
    another GtkStack [Florian Müllner, #284, !347]
  * GLib.strdelimit crashes [Philip Chimento, #283, !340]

Version 1.58.0
--------------

- No change from 1.57.92.

Version 1.57.92
---------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * tests: Enable regression test cases for GPtrArrays and GArrays of structures
    [Stéphane Seng, !334]
  * Various maintenance [Philip Chimento, !333, !335]

Version 1.57.91
---------------

- GJS no longer links to libgtk-3. This makes it possible to load the Gtk-4.0
  typelib in GJS and write programs that use GTK 4.

- The heapgraph tool has gained some improvements; it is now possible to print a
  heap graph of multiple targets. You can also mark an object for better
  identification in the heap graph by assigning a magic property: for example,
  myObject.__heapgraph_name = 'Button' will make that object identify itself as
  "Button" in heap graphs.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Remove usage of Lang in non legacy code [Sonny Piers, !322]
  * GTK4 [Florian Müllner, #99, !328, !330]
  * JS syntax fixes [Marco Trevisan, Philip Chimento, !306, !323]
  * gi: Avoid infinite recursion when converting GValues [Florian Müllner, !329]
  * Implement all GObject-introspection test suites [Philip Chimento, !327,
    !332]
  * Heapgraph improvements [Philip Chimento, !325]

Version 1.57.90
---------------

- New JS API: GLib.Variant has gained a recursiveUnpack() method which
  transforms the variant entirely into a JS object, discarding all type
  information. This can be useful for dealing with a{sv} dictionaries, where
  deepUnpack() will keep the values as GLib.Variant instances in order to

- New JS API: GLib.Variant has gained a deepUnpack() method which is exactly the
  same as the already existing deep_unpack(), but fits with the other camelCase
  APIs that GJS adds.

Version 1.57.4
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * gjs 1.57 requires a recent sysprof version for sysprof-capture-3 [#258,
    !309, Olivier Fourdan]

- Misc documentation changes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.57.3
--------------

- The GJS profiler is now integrated directly into Sysprof 3, via the
  GJS_TRACE_FD environment variable. Call stack information and garbage
  collector timing will show up in Sysprof. See also GNOME/Initiatives#10

- New JS API: System.addressOfGObject(obj) will return a string with the hex
  address of the underlying GObject of `obj` if it is a GObject wrapper, or
  throw an exception if it is not. This is intended for debugging.

- New JS API: It's now possible to pass a value from Gio.DBusProxyFlags to the
  constructor of a class created by Gio.DBusProxy.makeProxyWrapper().

- Backwards-incompatible change: Trying to read a write-only property on a DBus
  proxy object, or write a read-only property, will now throw an exception.
  Previously it would fail silently. It seems unlikely any code is relying on
  the old behaviour, and if so then it was probably masking a bug.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Build failure on Continuous [#253, !300, Philip Chimento]

  * GjsMaybeOwned: Reduce allocation when used as Object member [!303, Marco
    Trevisan]

Version 1.57.2
--------------

- There are now overrides for Gio.SettingsSchema and Gio.Settings which avoid
  aborting the whole process when trying to access a nonexistent key or child
  schema. The original API from GLib was intended for apps, since apps should
  have complete control over which settings keys they are allowed to access.
  However, it is not a good fit for shell extensions, which may need to access
  different settings keys depending on the version of GNOME shell they're
  running on.

  This feature is based on code from Cinnamon which the copyright holders have
  kindly agreed to relicense to GJS's license.

- New JS API: It is now possible to pass GObject.TypeFlags to
  GObject.registerClass(). For example, passing
  `GTypeFlags: GObject.TypeFlags.ABSTRACT` in the class info object, will create
  a class that cannot be instantiated. This functionality was present in
  Lang.Class but has been missing from GObject.registerClass().

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Document logging features [#230, !288, Andy Holmes]
  * Support optional GTypeFlags value in GObject subclasses [!290, Florian

---------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * NMake/libgjs-private: Export all the public symbols there [!275, Chun-wei
    Fan]

Version 1.55.91
---------------

- The problem of freezing while running the tests using GCC's sanitizers was
  determined to be a bug in GCC, which was fixed in GCC 9.0.1.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * gnome-sound-recorder crashes deep inside libgjs [#223, !266, Philip
    Chimento]
  * Various maintenance [!267, Philip Chimento]
  * wrapperutils: Define $gtype property as non-enumerable [!268, Philip
    Chimento]

Version 1.55.90
---------------

- New JS API: It's now possible to call and implement DBus methods whose
  parameters or return types include file descriptor lists (type signature 'h'.)
  This involves passing or receiving a Gio.UnixFDList instance along with the
  parameters or return values.

  To call a method with a file descriptor list, pass the Gio.UnixFDList along
  with the rest of the parameters, in any order, the same way you would pass a
  Gio.Cancellable or async callback.

  For return values, things are a little more complicated, in order to avoid
  breaking existing code. Previously, synchronously called DBus proxy methods
  would return an unpacked GVariant. Now, but only if called with a
  Gio.UnixFDList, they will return [unpacked GVariant, Gio.UnixFDList]. This
  does not break existing code because it was not possible to call a method with
  a Gio.UnixFDList before, and the return value is unchanged if not calling with
  a Gio.UnixFDList. This does mean, unfortunately, that if you have a method
  with an 'h' in its return signature but not in its argument signatures, you
  will have to call it with an empty FDList in order to receive an FDList with
  the return value, when calling synchronously.

  On the DBus service side, when receiving a method call, we now pass the
  Gio.UnixFDList received from DBus to the called method. Previously, sync
  methods were passed the parameters, and async methods were passed the
  parameters plus the Gio.DBusInvocation object. Appending the Gio.UnixFDList to
  those parameters also should not break existing code.

  See the new tests in installed-tests/js/testGDBus.js for examples of calling
  methods with FD lists.

- We have observed on the CI server that GJS 1.55.90 will hang forever while
  running the test suite compiled with GCC 9.0.0 and configured with the
  --enable-asan and --enable-ubsan arguments. This should be addressed in one of
  the following 1.55.x releases.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * GDBus proxy overrides should support Gio.DBusProxy.call_with_unix_fd_list()
    [#204, !263, Philip Chimento]

    Chimento]
  * signals: Add _signalHandlerIsConnected method [!255, Jason Hicks]

Version 1.52.5
--------------

- This was a release consisting only of backports from the GNOME 3.30 branch to
  the GNOME 3.28 branch.

- This release includes the "Big Hammer" patch from GNOME 3.30 to reduce memory
  usage. For more information, read the blog post at
  https://feaneron.com/2018/04/20/the-infamous-gnome-shell-memory-leak/
  It was not originally intended to be backported to GNOME 3.28, but in practice
  several Linux distributions already backported it, and it has been working
  well to reduce memory usage, and the bugs have been ironed out of it.

  It does decrease performance somewhat, so if you don't want that then don't
  install this update.

  arrays returned from GObject-introspected functions is now restored. If you
  use the functionality, a warning will be logged asking you to upgrade your
  code.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * byteArray: Add compatibility toString property [Philip Chimento, !227]

Version 1.53.92
---------------

- Technology preview of a GNOME 3.32 feature: native Promises for GIO-style
  asynchronous operations. This is the result of Avi Zajac's summer internship.
  To use it, you can opt in once for each specific asynchronous method, by
  including code such as the following:

      Gio._promisify(Gio.InputStream.prototype, 'read_bytes_async',
          'read_bytes_finish');

  After executing this, you will be able to use native Promises with the
  Gio.InputStream.prototype.read_async() method, simply by not passing a
  callback to it:

      try {
          let bytes = await stream.read_bytes_async(count, priority, cancel);
      } catch (e) {
          logError(e, 'Failed to read bytes');
      }

  Note that any "success" boolean return values are deleted from the array of
  return values from the async method. That is,

      let [contents, etag] = file.load_contents_async(cancel);

  whereas the callback version still returns a useless [ok, contents, etag]
  that can never be false, since on false an exception would be thrown. In the
  callback version, we must keep this for compatibility reasons.

  Note that due to a bug in GJS (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs/issues/189),
  promisifying methods on Gio.File.prototype and other interface prototypes will
  not work. We provide the API Gio._LocalFilePrototype on which you can
  promisify methods that will work on Gio.File instances on the local disk only:

      Gio._promisify(Gio._LocalFilePrototype, 'load_contents_async',
          'load_contents_finish');

  We estimate this will cover many common use cases.

  Since this is a technology preview, we do not guarantee API stability with
  the version coming in GNOME 3.32. These APIs are marked with underscores to
  emphasize that they are not stable yet. Use them at your own risk.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:
  * Added promisify to GJS GIO overrides [!225, Avi Zajac]
  * Temporary fix for Gio.File.prototype [!226, Avi Zajac]

Version 1.53.91

  * Fix example eslint errors [!207, Claudio André, Philip Chimento]
  * Fix more "lost" GInterface properties [!223, Florian Müllner]
  * Fix --enable-installed-tests when built from a tarball [!224, Simon
    McVittie]

Version 1.53.90
---------------

- GJS now depends on SpiderMonkey 60 and requires a compiler capable of C++14.

- GJS includes a simple debugger now. It has basic stepping, breaking, and
  printing commands, that work like GDB. Activate it by running the GJS console
  interpreter with the -d or --debugger flag before the name of the JS program
  on the command line.

- New API for programs that embed GJS: gjs_context_setup_debugger_console().
  To integrate the debugger into programs that embed the GJS interpreter, call
  this before executing the JS program.

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 60, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 52.
  Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New syntax
    + `for await (... of ...)` syntax is used for async iteration.
    + The rest operator is now supported in object destructuring: e.g.
      `({a, b, ...cd} = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4});`
    + The spread operator is now supported in object literals: e.g.
      `mergedObject = {...obj1, ...obj2};`
    + Generator methods can now be async, using the `async function*` syntax,
      or `async* f() {...}` method shorthand.
    + It's now allowed to omit the variable binding from a catch statement, if
      you don't need to access the thrown exception: `try {...} catch {}`

  * New APIs
    + Promise.prototype.finally(), popular in many third-party Promise
      libraries, is now available natively.
    + String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase() and
      String.prototype.toLocaleUpperCase() now take an optional locale or
      array of locales.
    + Intl.PluralRules is now available.
    + Intl.NumberFormat.protoype.formatToParts() is now available.
    + Intl.Collator now has a caseFirst option.
    + Intl.DateTimeFormat now has an hourCycle option.

  * New behaviour
    + There are a lot of minor behaviour changes as SpiderMonkey's JS
      implementation conforms ever closer to ECMAScript standards. For complete
      information, read the Firefox developer release notes:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/53#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/54#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/55#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/56#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/57#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/58#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/59#JavaScript
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/60#JavaScript

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + Conditional catch clauses have been removed, as they were a Mozilla
      extension which will not be standardized. This requires some attention in
      GJS programs, as previously we condoned code like `catch (e if
      e.matches(Gio.IOError, Gio.IOError.EXISTS))`  with a comment in
      overrides/GLib.js, so it's likely this is used in several places.
    + The nonstandard `for each (... in ...)` loop was removed.
    + The nonstandard legacy lambda syntax (`function(x) x*x`) was removed.
    + The nonstandard Mozilla iteration protocol was removed, as well as
      nonstandard Mozilla generators, including the Iterator and StopIteration
      objects, and the Function.prototype.isGenerator() method.
    + Array comprehensions and generator comprehensions have been removed.
    + Several nonstandard methods were removed: ArrayBuffer.slice() (but not
      the standard version, ArrayBuffer.prototype.slice()),
      Date.prototype.toLocaleFormat(), Function.prototype.isGenerator(),
      Object.prototype.watch(), and Object.prototype.unwatch().

- Many of the above backwards-incompatible changes can be caught by scanning
  your source code using https://gitlab.gnome.org/ptomato/moz60tool, or
  https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1455/spidermonkey-60-migration-validator/

- Deprecation: the custom ByteArray is now discouraged. Instead of ByteArray,
  use Javascript's native Uint8Array. The ByteArray module still contains
  functions for converting between byte arrays, strings, and GLib.Bytes
  instances.

  The old ByteArray will continue to work as before, except that Uint8Array
  will now be returned from introspected functions that previously returned a
  ByteArray. To keep your old code working, change this:

      let byteArray = functionThatReturnsByteArray();

  to this:

      let byteArray = new ByteArray.ByteArray(functionThatReturnsByteArray());

  To port to the new code:

  * ByteArray.ByteArray -> Uint8Array
  * ByteArray.fromArray() -> Uint8Array.from()
  * ByteArray.ByteArray.prototype.toString() -> ByteArray.toString()
  * ByteArray.ByteArray.prototype.toGBytes() -> ByteArray.toGBytes()
  * ByteArray.fromString(), ByteArray.fromGBytes() remain the same

  * Unlike ByteArray, Uint8Array's length is fixed. Assigning an element past
    the end of a ByteArray would lengthen the array. Now, it is ignored.
    Instead use Uint8Array.of(), for example, this code:

        let a = ByteArray.fromArray([97, 98, 99, 100]);
        a[4] = 101;

    should be replaced by this code:

        let a = Uint8Array.from([97, 98, 99, 100]);
        a = Uint8Array.of(...a, 101);

    The length of the byte array must be set at creation time. This code will
    not work anymore:

        let a = new ByteArray.ByteArray();
        a[0] = 255;

    Instead, use "new Uint8Array(1)" to reserve the correct length.

- Refactored the way GObject properties are accessed. This should be a bit more
  efficient, as property info (GParamSpec) is now cached for every object type.
  There may still be some regressions from this; please be on the lookout so
  we can fix them in the next release.

- The memory usage for each object instance has been reduced, resulting in
  several dozens of megabytes less memory usage in GNOME Shell.

- The CI pipeline was refactored, now runs a lot faster, detects more failure
  situations, builds on different architectures, uses the GitLab Docker
  registry, and publishes code coverage statistics to
  https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gjs/

- For contributors, the C++ style guide has been updated, and there is now a
  script in the tools/ directory that will install a Git hook to automatically
  format your code when you commit it. The configuration may not be perfect yet,
  so bear with us while we get it right.

Version 1.53.3
--------------

- This release was made from an earlier state of master, before a bug was
  introduced, while we sort out how to fix it. As a result, we don't have too
  many changes this round.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Adding multiple ESLint rules for spacing [!152, Avi Zajac]
  * Various maintenance [!153, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.53.2
--------------

  file:/// URIs as well as resource:/// URIs and byte arrays.

- New API: `gjs_get_js_version()` returns a string identifying the version of
  the underlying SpiderMonkey JS engine. The interpreter executable has also
  gained a `--jsversion` argument which will print this string.

- Several fixes for memory efficiency and performance.

- Once again we welcomed contributions from a number of first-time contributors!

  * Fix debug logging [!148, Philip Chimento]
  * CI: add a GC zeal test [!149, Claudio André]

Version 1.53.1
--------------

- Improvements to garbage collection performance. Read for more information:
  https://feaneron.com/2018/04/20/the-infamous-gnome-shell-memory-leak/

- Now, when building a class from a UI template file (using the `Template`
  parameter passed to `GObject.registerClass()`, for example) signals defined in
  the UI template file will be automatically connected.

- As an experimental feature, we now offer a flatpak built with each GJS commit,
  including branches. You can use this to test your apps with a particular GJS
  branch before it is merged. Look for it in the "Artifacts" section of the CI
  pipeline.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Tweener: Add min/max properties [!67, Jason Hicks]
  * `ARGV` encoding issues [#22, !108, Evan Welsh]
  * Make GC much more aggressive [#62, !50, Giovanni Campagna, Georges Basile
    Stavracas Neto, Philip Chimento]

  * CI: Un-pin the Fedora Docker image [#141, !131, Claudio André]
  * Reduce overhead of wrapped objects [#142, !121, Carlos Garnacho, Philip
    Chimento]
  * Various CI changes [!134, !136, Claudio André]

Version 1.52.2
--------------

- This is an unscheuled release in order to revert a commit that causes a crash
  on exit, with some Cairo versions.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * CI: pinned Fedora to old tag [!119, Claudio André]
  * heapgraph.py: adjust terminal output style [!120, Andy Holmes]
  * CI: small tweaks [!123, Claudio André]
  * Warn about compilation warnings [!125, Claudio André]
  * Miscellaneous commits [Philip Chimento, Jason Hicks]

Version 1.52.1
--------------

- This version has more changes than would normally be expected from a stable
  version. The intention of 1.52.1 is to deliver a version that runs cleaner
  under performance tools, in time for the upcoming GNOME Shell performance
  hackfest. We also wanted to deliver a stable CI pipeline before branching
  GNOME 3.28 off of master.

- Claudio André's work on the CI pipeline deserves a spotlight. We now have
  test jobs that run linters, sanitizers, Valgrind, and more; the tests are
  run on up-to-date Docker images; and the reliability errors that were plaguing
  the test runs are solved.

- In addition to System.dumpHeap(), you can now dump a heap from a running
  Javascript program by starting it with the environment variable
  GJS_DEBUG_HEAP_OUTPUT=some_name, and sending it SIGUSR1.

- heapgraph.py is a tool in the repository (not installed in distributions) for
  analyzing and graphing heap dumps, to aid with tracking down memory leaks.

- The linter CI jobs will compare your branch against GNOME/gjs@master, and fail
  if your branch added any new linter errors. There may be false positives, and
  the rules configuration is not perfect. If that's the case on your merge
  request, you can skip the appropriate linter job by adding the text
  "[skip (linter)]" in your commit message: e.g., "[skip cpplint]".

- We welcomed first merge requests from several new contributors for this
  release.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Crash when resolving promises if exception is pending [#18, !95, Philip
    Chimento]
  * gjs_byte_array_get_proto(JSContext*): assertion failed: (((void) "gjs_"
    "byte_array" "_define_proto() must be called before " "gjs_" "byte_array"
    "_get_proto()", !v_proto.isUndefined())) [#39, !92, Philip Chimento]
  * Tools for examining heap graph [#116, !61, !118, Andy Holmes, Tommi
    Komulainen, Philip Chimento]
  * Run analysis tools to prepare for release [#120, !88, Philip Chimento]
  * Add support for passing flags to Gio.DBusProxy in makeProxyWrapper [#122,

    André, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.52.0
--------------

- No changes from 1.51.92 except for the continuous integration configuration.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Various CI improvements [!84, !85, !86, !87, Claudio André]

Version 1.51.92
---------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * abort if we are called back in a non-main thread [#75, !72, Philip Chimento]
  * 3.27.91 build failure on debian/Ubuntu [#122, !73, Tim Lunn]
  * Analyze project code quality with Code Climate inside CI [#10, !77, Claudio
    André]
  * Various CI improvements [!75, !76, !79, !80, !82, !83, Claudio André]

Version 1.51.91
---------------

- Promises now resolve with a higher priority, so asynchronous code should be
  faster. [Jason Hicks]

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * New build 'warnings' [#117, !62, !63, Claudio André, Philip Chimento]
  * Various CI maintenance [!64, !65, !66, Claudio André, Philip Chimento]
  * profiler: Don't include alloca.h when disabled [!69, Ting-Wei Lan]
  * GNOME crash with fatal error "Finalizing proxy for an object that's
    scheduled to be unrooted: Gio.Subprocess" in gjs [#26, !70, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.51.90
---------------

- Note that all the old Bugzilla bug reports have been migrated over to GitLab.

- GJS now, once again, includes a profiler, which outputs files that can be
  read with sysprof. To use it, simply run your program with the environment
  variable GJS_ENABLE_PROFILER=1 set. If your program is a JS script that is
  executed with the interpreter, you can also pass --profile to the
  interpreter. See "gjs --help" for more info.

- New API: For programs that want more control over when to start and stop
  profiling, there is new API for GjsContext. When you create your GjsContext
  there are two construct-only properties available, "profiler-enabled" and
  "profiler-sigusr2". If you set profiler-sigusr2 to TRUE, then the profiler
  can be started and stopped while the program is running by sending SIGUSR2 to
  the process. You can also use gjs_context_get_profiler(),
  gjs_profiler_set_filename(), gjs_profiler_start(), and gjs_profiler_stop()
  for more explicit control.

- New API: GObject.signal_connect(), GObject.signal_disconnect(), and
  GObject.signal_emit_by_name() are now available in case a GObject-derived
  class has conflicting connect(), disconnect() or emit() methods.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Handle 0-valued GType gracefully [#11, !10, Philip Chimento]
  * Profiler [#31, !37, Christian Hergert, Philip Chimento]
  * Various maintenance [!40, !59, Philip Chimento, Giovanni Campagna]
  * Rename GObject.Object.connect/disconnect? [#65, !47, Giovanni Campagna]
  * Better debugging output for uncatchable exceptions [!39, Simon McVittie]
  * Update Docker images and various CI maintenance [!54, !56, !57, !58,
    Claudio André]
  * Install GJS suppression file for Valgrind [#2, !55, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.50.4
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Gnome Shell crash with places-status extension when you plug an USB device
    [#33, !38, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.50.3
--------------

- GJS will now log a warning when a GObject is accessed in Javascript code
  after the underlying object has been freed in C. (This used to work most of
  the time, but crash unpredictably.) We now prevent this situation which, is
  usually caused by a memory management bug in the underlying C library.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Add checks for GObjects that have been finalized [#21, #23, !25, !28, !33,
    Marco Trevisan]
  * Test "Cairo context has methods when created from a C function" fails [#27,
    !35, Valentín Barros]
  * Various fixes from the master branch for rare crashes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.51.4
--------------

- We welcomed code and documentation from several new contributors in this
  release!

- GJS will now log a warning when a GObject is accessed in Javascript code
  after the underlying object has been freed in C. (This used to work most of
  the time, but crash unpredictably.) We now prevent this situation which, is
  usually caused by a memory management bug in the underlying C library.

- APIs exposed through GObject Introspection that use the GdkAtom type are now
  usable from Javascript. Previously these did not work. On the Javascript side,
  a GdkAtom translates to a string, so there is no Gdk.Atom type that you can
  access. The special atom GDK_NONE translates to null in Javascript, and there
  is also no Gdk.NONE constant.

- The GitLab CI tasks have continued to gradually become more and more
  sophisticated.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Add checks for GObjects that have been finalized [#21, #23, !22, !27, Marco
    Trevisan]
  * Fail static analyzer if new warnings are found [!24, Claudio André]
  * Run code coverage on GitLab [!20, Claudio André]
  * Amend gtk.js and add gtk-application.js with suggestion [!32, Andy Holmes]
  * Improve GdkAtom support that is blocking clipboard APIs [#14, !29, makepost]
  * Test "Cairo context has methods when created from a C function" fails [#27,
    !35, Valentín Barros]
  * Various CI improvements [#6, !26, !34, Claudio André]
  * Various maintenance [!23, !36, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.51.3
--------------

- This release was made from an earlier state of master, before a breaking
  change was merged, while we decide whether to revert that change or not.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * CI improvements on GitLab [!14, !15, !19, Claudio André]
  * Fix CI build on Ubuntu [#16, !18, !21, Claudio André, Philip Chimento]

Version 1.51.2
--------------

- Version 1.51.1 was skipped.

- The home of GJS is now at GNOME's GitLab instance:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs
  From now on we'll be taking GitLab merge requests instead of Bugzilla
  patches. If you want to report a bug, please report it at GitLab.

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * Allow throwing GErrors from JS virtual functions [#682701, Giovanni
    Campagna]
  * [RFC] bootstrap system [#777724, Jasper St. Pierre, Philip Chimento]
  * Fix code coverage (and refactor it to take advantage of mozjs52 features)
    [#788166, !1, !3, Philip Chimento]
  * Various maintenance [!2, Philip Chimento]
  * Get GitLab CI working and various improvements [#6, !7, !9, !11, !13,
    Claudio André]
  * Add build status badge to README [!8, Claudio André]
  * Use Docker images for CI [!12, Claudio André]

- Some changes in progress to improve garbage collection when signals are
  disconnected. See bug #679688 for more information [Giovanni Campagna]

Version 1.50.2
--------------

- Closed bugs and merge requests:

  * tweener: Fix a couple of warnings [!5, Florian Müllner]
  * legacy: Allow ES6 classes to inherit from abstract Lang.Class class [!6,
    Florian Müllner]

- Minor bugfixes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.50.1
--------------

- As a debugging aid, gjs_dumpstack() now works even during garbage collection.

- Code coverage tools did not work so well in the last few 1.49 releases. The
  worst problems are now fixed, although even more improvements will be
  released in the next unstable version. Fixes include:

  * Specifing prefixes for code coverage files now works again
  * Code coverage now works on lines inside ES6 class definitions
  * The detection of which lines are executable has been improved a bit

Version 1.50.0
--------------

- Closed bugs:

  * Relicense coverage.cpp and coverage.h to the same license as the rest of
    GJS [#787263, Philip Chimento; thanks to Dominique Leuenberger for pointing
    out the mistake]

Version 1.49.92
---------------

- It's now possible to build GJS with sanitizers (ASan and UBSan) enabled; add
  "--enable-asan" and "--enable-ubsan" to your configure flags. This has
  already caught some memory leaks.

- There's also a "make check-valgrind" target which will run GJS's test suite
  under Valgrind to catch memory leaks and threading races.

- Many of the crashes in GNOME 3.24 were caused by GJS's closure invalidation
  code which had to change from the known-working state in 1.46 because of
  changes to SpiderMonkey's garbage collector. This code has been refactored to
  be less complicated, which will hopefully improve stability and debuggability.

- Closed bugs:

  * Clean up the idle closure invalidation mess [#786668, Philip Chimento]
  * Add ASan and UBSan to GJS [#783220, Claudio André]
  * Run analysis tools on GJS to prepare for release [#786995, Philip Chimento]
  * Fix testLegacyGObject importing the GTK overrides [#787113, Philip Chimento]

- Docs tweak [Philip Chimento]

1.49.91
-------

- Deprecation: The private "__name__" property on Lang.Class instances is
  now discouraged. Code should not have been using this anyway, but if it did
  then it should use the "name" property on the class (this.__name__ should
  become this.constructor.name), which is compatible with ES6 classes.

- Closed bugs:

  * Use ES6 classes [#785652, Philip Chimento]
  * A few fixes for stack traces and error reporting [#786183, Philip Chimento]
  * /proc/self/stat is read for every frame if GC was not needed [#786017,
    Benjamin Berg]

- Build fix [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.49.90
---------------

- New API: GObject.registerClass(), intended for use with ES6 classes. When
  defining a GObject class using ES6 syntax, you must call
  GObject.registerClass() on the class object, with an optional metadata
  object as the first argument. (The metadata object works exactly like the
  meta properties from Lang.Class, except that Name and Extends are not
  present.)

  Old:

      var MyClass = new Lang.Class({
          Name: 'MyClass',
          Extends: GObject.Object,
          Signals: { 'event': {} },
          _init(props={}) {
              this._private = [];
              this.parent(props);
          },
      });

  New:

      var MyClass = GObject.registerClass({
          Signals: { 'event': {} },
      }, class MyClass extends GObject.Object {
          _init(props={}) {
              this._private = [];
              super._init(props);
          }
      });

  It is forward compatible with the following syntax requiring decorators and
  class fields, which are not in the JS standard yet:

      @GObject.registerClass
      class MyClass extends GObject.Object {
          static [GObject.signals] = { 'event': {} }
          _init(props={}) {
              this._private = [];
              super._init(props);
          }
      }

  One limitation is that GObject ES6 classes can't have constructor()
  methods, they must do any setup in an _init() method. This may be able to be
  fixed in the future.

- Closed bugs:

  * Misc 1.49 and mozjs52 enhancements [#785040, Philip Chimento]
  * Switch to native promises [#784713, Philip Chimento]
  * Can't call exports using top-level variable toString [#781623, Philip
    Chimento]
  * Properties no longer recognized when shadowed by a method [#785091, Philip
    Chimento, Rico Tzschichholz]
  * Patch: backport of changes required for use with mozjs-55 [#785424, Luke
    Jones]

Version 1.48.6
--------------

- Closed bugs:

  * GJS crash in needsPostBarrier, possible access from wrong thread [#783935,
    Philip Chimento] (again)

Version 1.49.4
--------------

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 52, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 38.
  GJS now uses the latest ESR in its engine and the plan is to upgrade again
  when SpiderMonkey 59 is released in March 2018, pending maintainer
  availability. Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New language features
    + ES6 classes
    + Async functions and await operator
    + Reflect - built-in object with methods for interceptable operations

  * New syntax
    + Exponentiation operator: `**`
    + Variable-length Unicode code point escapes: `"\u{1f369}"`
    + Destructured default arguments: `function f([x, y]=[1, 2], {z: z}={z: 3})`
    + Destructured rest parameters: `function f(...[a, b, c])`
    + `new.target` allows a constructor access to the original constructor that
      was invoked
    + Unicode (u) flag for regular expressions, and corresponding RegExp.unicode
      property
    + Trailing comma in function parameter lists now allowed

  * New APIs
    + New Array, String, and TypedArray method: includes()
    + TypedArray sort(), toLocaleString(), and toString() methods, to correspond
      with regular arrays
    + New Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors() and Object.values() methods
    + New Proxy traps: getPrototypeOf() and setPrototypeOf()
    + [Symbol.toPrimitive] property specifying how to convert an object to a
      primitive value
    + [Symbol.species] property allowing to override the default constructor
      for objects
    + [Symbol.match], [Symbol.replace], [Symbol.search], and [Symbol.split]
      properties allowing to customize matching behaviour in RegExp subclasses
    + [Symbol.hasInstance] property allowing to customize the behaviour of
      the instanceof operator for objects
    + [Symbol.toStringTag] property allowing to customize the message printed
      by Object.toString() without overriding it
    + [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable] property allowing to control the behaviour of
      an array subclass in an argument list to Array.concat()
    + [Symbol.unscopables] property allowing to control which object properties
      are lifted into the scope of a with statement
    + New Intl.getCanonicalLocales() method
    + Date.toString() and RegExp.toString() generic methods
    + Typed arrays can now be constructed from any iterable object
    + Array.toLocaleString() gained optional locales and options arguments, to
      correspond with other toLocaleString() methods

  * New behaviour
    + The "arguments" object is now iterable
    + Date.prototype, WeakMap.prototype, and WeakSet.prototype are now ordinary
      objects, not instances
    + Full ES6-compliant implementation of let keyword
    + RegExp.sticky ('y' flag) behaviour is ES6 standard, it used to be subject
      to a long-standing bug in Firefox
    + RegExp constructor with RegExp first argument and flags no longer throws
      an exception (`new RegExp(/ab+c/, 'i')` works now)
    + Generators are no longer constructible, as per ES6 (`function* f {}`
      followed by `new f` will not work)
    + It is now required to construct ArrayBuffer, TypedArray, Map, Set, and
      WeakMap with the new operator
    + Block-level functions (e.g. `{ function foo() {} }`) are now allowed in
      strict mode; they are scoped to their block
    + The options.timeZone argument to Date.toLocaleDateString(),
      Date.toLocaleString(), Date.toLocaleTimeString(), and the constructor of
      Intl.DateTimeFormat now understands IANA time zone names (such as
      "America/Vancouver")

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + Non-standard "let expressions" and "let blocks" (e.g.,
      `let (x = 5) { use(x) }`) are not supported any longer
    + Non-standard flags argument to String.match(), String.replace(), and
      String.search() (e.g. `str.replace('foo', 'bar', 'g')`) is now ignored
    + Non-standard WeakSet.clear() method has been removed
    + Variables declared with let and const are now 'global lexical bindings',
      as per the ES6 standard, meaning that they will not be exported in
      modules. We are maintaining the old behaviour for the time being as a
      compatibility workaround, but please change "let" or "const" to "var"
      inside your module file. A warning will remind you of this. For more
      information, read:

Version 1.47.90
---------------

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 38, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 31.
  Our plans are to continue upgrading to subsequent ESRs as maintainer
  availability allows. Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New syntax
    + Shorthand syntax for method definitions: { foo() { return 5; } }
    + Shorthand syntax for object literals: let b = 42; let o = {b}; o.b === 42
    + Computed property names for the above, as well as in getter and setter
      expressions and destructuring assignment: { ['b' + 'ar']() { return 6; } }
    + Spread operator in destructuring assignment: let [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3];
    + Template literals: `Hello, ${name}` with optional tags: tag`string`

  * New APIs
    + Symbol, a new fundamental type
    + WeakSet, a Set which does not prevent its members from being
      garbage-collected
    + [Symbol.iterator] properties for Array, Map, Set, String, TypedArray, and
      the arguments object
    + New Array and TypedArray functionality: Array.copyWithin(), Array.from()
    + New return() method for generators
    + New Number.isSafeInteger() method
    + New Object.assign() method which can replace Lang.copyProperties() in many
      cases
    + New Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() method
    + New RegExp flags, global, ignoreCase, multiline, sticky properties that
      give access to the flags that the regular expression was created with
    + String.raw, a tag for template strings similar to Python's r""
    + New TypedArray methods for correspondence with Array: entries(), every(),
      fill(), filter(), find(), findIndex(), forEach(), indexOf(), join(),
      keys(), lastIndexOf(), map(), of(), reduce(), reduceRight(), reverse(),
      slice(), some(), values()

  * New behaviour
    + Temporal dead zone: print(x); let x = 5; no longer allowed
    + Full ES6-compliant implementation of const keyword
    + The Set, Map, and WeakMap constructors can now take null as their argument
    + The WeakMap constructor can now take an iterable as its argument
    + The Function.name and Function.length properties are configurable
    + When subclassing Map, WeakMap, and Set or using the constructors on
      generic objects, they will look for custom set() and add() methods.
    + RegExp.source and RegExp.toString() now deal with empty regexes, and
      escape their output.
    + Non-object arguments to Object.preventExtensions() now do not throw an
      exception, simply return the original object

  * Backwards-incompatible changes
    + It is now a syntax error to declare the same variable twice with "let" or
      "const" in the same scope. Existing code may need to be fixed, but the
      fix is trivial.
    + SpiderMonkey is now extra vocal about warning when you access an
      undefined property, and this causes some false positives. You can turn
      this warning off by setting GJS_DISABLE_EXTRA_WARNINGS=1. If it is overly
      annoying, let me know and I will consider making it disabled by default
      in a future release.
    + When enumerating the importer object (i.e.,
      "for (let i in imports) {...}") you will now get the names of any built-in
      modules that have previously been imported. (But don't do this, anyway.)

- Closed bugs:

  * SpiderMonkey 38 prep [#776966, Philip Chimento]
  * Misc fixes [#777205, Philip Chimento]
  * missing class name in error message [#642506, Philip Chimento]
  * Add continuous integration to GJS [#776549, Claudio André]
  * Switch to SpiderMonkey 38 [#777962, Philip Chimento]

- Progress towards a build of GJS on Windows [Chun-wei Fan]
- Progress towards increasing test coverage [Claudio André]
- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento]

Version 1.47.4
--------------

- New JavaScript feature: ES6 Promises. This release includes Lie [1], a small,
  self-contained Promise implementation, which is imported automatically to
  form the Promise global object [2]. In the future, Promises will be built into
  the SpiderMonkey engine and Lie will be removed, but any code using Promises
  will continue to work as before.

  [2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * New API: The GjsCoverage type and its methods are now exposed. Use this if
    you are embedding GJS and need to output code coverage statistics.

- Closed bugs:

  * Add GjsCoverage to gjs-1.0 public API [#775776, Philip Chimento]
  * Should use uint32_t instead of u_int32_t in coverage.cpp [#776193, Shawn
    Walker, Alan Coopersmith]

  * support fields in GObject [#563391, Havoc Pennington, Philip Chimento]
  * Javascript errors in property getters and setter not always reported
    [#730101, Matt Watson, Philip Chimento]
  * Exception swallowed while importing Gom [#737607, Philip Chimento]
  * log a warning if addSignalMethods() replaces existing methods [#619710, Joe
    Shaw, Philip Chimento]
  * Provide a useful toString for importer and module objects [#636283, Jasper
    St. Pierre, Philip Chimento]
  * Fails to marshal out arrays [#697020, Paolo Borelli]
  * coverage: Don't warn about executing odd lines by default anymore [#751146,
    Sam Spilsbury, Philip Chimento]
  * coverage: Crash in EnterBaseline on SpiderMonkey when Ion is enabled during
    coverage mode. [#742852, Sam Spilsbury, Philip Chimento]
  * installed tests cannot load libregress.so [#776938, Philip Chimento]
  * Crash with subclassed fundamental with no introspection [#760057, Lionel
    Landwerlin]

- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento, Claudio André]

Version 1.47.3
--------------

- New JavaScript features! This version of GJS is based on SpiderMonkey 31, an
  upgrade from the previous ESR (Extended Support Release) of SpiderMonkey 24.
  Our plans are to continue upgrading to subsequent ESRs as maintainer
  availability allows. Here are the highlights of the new JavaScript features.
  For more information, look them up on MDN or devdocs.io.

  * New syntax
    + Spread operator in function calls: someFunction(arg1, arg2, ...iterableObj)
    + Generator functions: yield, function*, yield*
    + Binary and octal numeric literals: 0b10011100, 0o377
    + Function arguments without defaults can now come after those with
      defaults: function f(x=1, y) {}

  * New standard library module
    + Intl - Locale-sensitive formatting and string comparison

  * New APIs
    + Iterator protocol - any object implementing certain methods is an
      "iterator"
    + New Array functionality: fill(), find(), findIndex(), of()
    + New String functionality for working with Unicode: codePointAt(),
      fromCodePoint(), normalize()
    + New Array methods for correspondence with Object: entries(), keys()
    + ES6 Generator methods to replace the old Firefox-specific generator API:
      next(), throw()
    + forEach() methods for Map and Set, for correspondence with Array
    + A bunch of new Math functions: acosh(), asinh(), atanh(), cbrt(), clz32(),
      cosh(), expm1(), fround(), hypot(), log10(), log1p(), log2(), sign(),
      sinh(), tanh(), trunc()
    + Some constants to tell information about float support on the platform:
      Number.EPSILON, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
    + New Number.parseInt() and Number.parseFloat() which are now preferred over
      those in the global namespace
    + New Object.setPrototypeOf() which now is preferred over setting
      obj.prototype.__proto__
    + New locales and options extra arguments to all toLocaleString() and
      related methods
    + Misc new functionality: ArrayBuffer.isView(), Proxy.handler.isExtensible,
      Proxy.revocable()

  * New behaviour
    + -0 and +0 are now considered equal as Map keys and Set values
    + On typed arrays, numerical indexed properties ignore the prototype object:
      Int8Array.prototype[20] = 'foo'; (new Int8Array(32))[20] == 0

  * New non-standard Mozilla extensions
    + Array comprehensions
    + Generator comprehensions; both were originally proposed for ES6 but removed

- Backwards-incompatible change: we have changed the way certain JavaScript
  values are marshalled into GObject introspection 32 or 64-bit signed integer
  values, to match the ECMA standard. Here is the relevant section of the
  standard:
  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-toint32
  Notable differences between the old and new behaviour are:

  * Floating-point numbers ending in 0.5 are rounded differently when
    marshalled into 32 or 64-bit signed integers. Previously they were
    rounded to floor(x + 0.5), now they are rounded to
    signum(x) * floor(abs(x)) as per the ECMA standard:
    http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-toint32
    Note that previously, GJS rounded according to the standard when
    converting to *unsigned* integers!

  * Objects whose number value is NaN (e.g, arrays of strings), would
    previously fail to convert, throwing a TypeError. Now they convert to
    0 when marshalled into 32 or 64-bit signed integers.

  Note that the new behaviour is the behaviour you got all along when using
  pure JavaScript, without any GObject introspection:

  gjs> let a = new Int32Array(2);
  gjs> a[0] = 10.5;
  10.5
  gjs> a[1] = ['this', 'is', 'fine'];
  this,is,fine
  gjs> a[0]
  10
  gjs> a[1]
  0

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * New API: gjs_error_quark() is now exposed, and the error domain GJS_ERROR
    and codes GJS_ERROR_FAILED and GJS_ERROR_SYSTEM_EXIT.

  * Backwards-incompatible change: Calling System.exit() from JS code will now
    not abort the program immediately, but instead will return immediately from
    gjs_context_eval() so that you can unref your GjsContext before internal
    resources are released on exit.

    If gjs_context_eval() or gjs_context_eval_file() returns an error with code
    GJS_ERROR_SYSTEM_EXIT, it means that the JS code called System.exit(). The
    exit code will be found in the 'exit_status_p' out parameter to
    gjs_context_eval() or gjs_context_eval_file(). If you receive this error,
    you should do any cleanup needed and exit your program with the given exit
    code.

- Closed bugs:

  * spidermonkey 31 prep [Philip Chimento, Tim Lunn, #742249]
  * Please use dbus-run-session to run dbus related tests [Philip Chimento,
    #771745]
  * don't abort gdb'd tests [Philip Chimento, Havoc Pennington, #605972]
  * Use Automake test suite runner [Philip Chimento, #775205]
  * please add doc/ directory to make dist tar file [Philip Chimento, #595439]
  * support new mozjs 31.5 [Philip Chimento, #751252]
  * SEGFAULT in js::NewObjectWithClassProtoCommon when instantiating a dynamic
    type defined in JS [Philip Chimento, Juan Pablo Ugarte, #770244]

- Misc bug fixes [Philip Chimento, Alexander Larsson]

Version 1.47.0
--------------

- New API: GLib.log_structured() is a convenience wrapper for the C function
  g_log_variant(), allowing you to do structured logging without creating
  GVariants by hand. For example:

  GLib.log_structured('test', GLib.LogLevelFlags.LEVEL_WARNING, {
      'MESSAGE': 'Just a test',
      'A_FIELD': 'A value',
  });

- Backwards-incompatible change: we have changed the way gjs-console interprets
  command-line arguments. Previously there was a heuristic to try to decide
  whether "--help" given on the command line was meant for GJS itself or for a
  script being launched. This did not work in some cases, for example:

  $ gjs -c 'if (ARGV.indexOf("--help") == -1) throw "ugh"' --help

  would print the GJS help.

  Now, all arguments meant for GJS itself must come _before_ the name of the
  script to execute or any script given with a "-c" argument. Any arguments
  _after_ the filename or script are passed on to the script. This is the way
  that Python handles its command line arguments as well.

  If you previously relied on any -I arguments after your script being added to
  the search path, then you should either reorder those arguments, use GJS_PATH,
  or handle -I inside your script, adding paths to imports.searchPath manually.

  In order to ease the pain of migration, GJS will continue to take those
  arguments into account for the time being, while still passing them on to the
  script. A warning will be logged if you are using the deprecated behaviour.

- News for GJS embedders such as gnome-shell:

  * Removed API: The gjs-internals-1.0 API is now discontinued. Since
    gnome-shell was the only known user of this API, its pkg-config file has
    been removed completely and gnome-shell has been patched not to use it.

- Closed bugs:

  * make check fails with --enable-debug / -DDEBUG spidermonkey [Philip
    Chimento, #573335]
  * Modernize autotools configuration [Philip Chimento, #772027]
  * overrides/GLib: Add log_structured() - wrapper for g_log_variant() [Jonh
    Wendell, #771598]
  * Remove gjs-internals-1.0 API [Philip Chimento, #772386]
  * Add support for boolean, gunichar, and 64-bit int arrays [Philip Chimento,
    #772790]
  * add a --version flag [Philip Chimento, #772033]
  * Switch to AX_COMPILER_FLAGS and compile warning-free [Philip Chimento,
    #773297]
  * Reinstate importer test [Philip Chimento, #773335]

Version 0.3 (03-Jul-2009)
-------------------------

Changes:
    - DBus support
      At a high level there are three pieces. First, the "gjs-dbus" library is
      a C support library for DBus.  Second, the modules/dbus*.[ch] implement
      parts of the JavaScript API in C.  Third, the modules/dbus.js file fills
      out the rest of the JavaScript API and implementation.
    - Support simple fields for boxed types
    - Support "copy construction" of boxed types
    - Support simple structures not registered as boxed
      - Allow access to nested structures
      - Allow direct assignment to nested structure fields
      - Allow enum and flag structure fields
      - Allow creating boxed wrapper without copy
    - Support for non-default constructor (i.e. constructors like
      GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf.new_from_file(file))
    - Add a Lang.bind function which binds the meaning of 'this'
    - Add an interactive console gjs-console
    - Allow code in directory modules (i.e. the code should reside in
      __init__.js files)
    - Fix handling of enum/flags return values
    - Handle non-gobject-registered flags
    - Add Tweener.registerSpecialProperty to tweener module
    - Add profiler for javascript code
    - Add gjs_context_get_all and gjs_dumpstack - useful to invoke from a
      debugger such as gdb
    - Support GHashTable
      - GHashTable return values/out parameters
      - Support GHashTable 'in' parameters
      - Convert JSON-style object to a GHashTable
    - Add support for UNIX shebang (i.e. #!/usr/bin/gjs-console)
    - Support new introspection short/ushort type tags
    - Support GI_TYPE_TAG_FILENAME
    - Improve support for machine-dependent integer types and arrays of
      integers
    - Fix several memory leaks
